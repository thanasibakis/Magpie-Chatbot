# Magpie Chatbot

This is my implementation of CollegeBoard's AP Computer Science A lab. The class's specification for it was mainly called for recognizing hardcoded statements, but I mainly added the capability to recognize simple grammar structures such as "I want to..." and contractions such as "They're...", as well as the ability to invert points of view and respond more interactively, such as "Why do you want to...".

I began this program in class sophomore year, but I have slowly improved upon it in my free time long afterwards.

To run the program, run the Java class MagpieRunner.
